= Health Check

Health Checks are important in platforms like Kubernetes because it allows the infrastructure to be aware of the state of the application.

There are two different types of health checks:

- *Liveness probes* tells your platform if your application is running ok or not. When your liveness probe is down, your platform might restart your instance to guarantee that you have the minimum required amount of running instances in production.

- *Readiness probes* tells your platform if your application is _warm_ enough to reply to requests in a reasonable amount of time. Java applications, for example, might need some time to warm up, so the readiness probe should be up only when it's ready to reply to request in a timely manner. Checks that depends on other services should be implemented as readiness probes: if a remote service is down, restarting your application won't fix the issue.

== Add the Health extension

Just open a new terminal window, and make sure youâ€™re at the root of your `{project-name}` project, then run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextension=quarkus-smallrye-health
----

== Invoke the /health endpoint

Just by adding the Health extension you'll have a `/q/health` endpoint providing a very trivial health check.

Run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/q/health
----

[.console-output]
[source,json]
----
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "Database connections health check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
----

Notice that since we're using the Hibernate and database extensions, Quarkus automatically added a readiness probe checking the status of our database connections.

TIP: You can modify the default path by adding the following property in `applications.properties` :
[.console-input]
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.smallrye-health.root-path=/health
----

== Add a custom liveness probe

Create a new `LivenessProbe` Java class in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Liveness;

@Liveness
public class LivenessProbe implements HealthCheck {
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up("I'm alive");
    }

}
----

== Add a custom readiness probe

Create a new `ReadinessProbe` Java class in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

@Readiness
public class ReadinessProbe implements HealthCheck{
    
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.builder()
            .name("database")
            .withData("connections", "10") <1>
            .up()
            .build();
    }

}
----
<1> You can use a `HealthCheckResponse` builder to add custom information to your health checks.

== Invoke the /health endpoint with custom probes

Run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/health
----

[.console-output]
[source, json]
----
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "I'm alive",
            "status": "UP"
        },
        {
            "name": "database",
            "status": "UP",
            "data": {
                "connections": "10"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Database connections health check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
----

You can see that the `/health` endpoint consolidates information from both the liveness and readiness probes.

== Invoke the liveness endpoint

Run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/health/live
----

[.console-output]
[source, json]
----
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "I'm alive",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
----

You can see that the liveness endpoints only returns information about the liveness probes.

== Invoke the readiness endpoint

Run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/health/ready
----

[.console-output]
[source, json]
----
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "database",
            "status": "UP",
            "data": {
                "connections": "10"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Database connections health check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
----

You can see that the readiness endpoints only returns information about the readiness probes.

== The Health extension and Kubernetes

NOTE: If you're using the Quarkus Kubernetes extension, the liveness and readiness probes are automatically configured in your `Deployment` when you generate the Kubernetes yaml files.
