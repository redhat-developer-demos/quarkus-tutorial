At the end of this chapter you will be able to :

* [x] Containerize the Quarkus Application
* [x] Build and run the Quarkus Application in Kubernetes

[#conk8s-prerequisite]
== Prerequisite

[#conk8s-build-container-app]
== Containerize Quarkus Application

:doc-sec: containers
include::ROOT:partial$build-containers.adoc[tag=build]

After containerizing the application, we can verify the container by running the following commands: 

:doc-sec: container
include::ROOT:partial$build-containers.adoc[tag=run]

You can <<conk8s-call-svc>> to see a response like `hello`.
 
[#conk8s-call-svc]
=== Invoke Service
The simple `hello` REST URI can be called via browser using `http://$(minikube ip)/fruit` or using CLI like: 

:doc-sec: basics
:k8s-cli: k8s
:path: fruit
:k8s-env: minikube
:cli-tool: curl
:address: $(minikube ip)
include::ROOT:partial$invoke-service.adoc[tag=call]

Then you can stop the container by typing kbd:[Ctrl+C].

[#conk8s-k8s-tag-containers]
=== Tag and push the container images

As we have already built the container images, we might need to build and push it to remote container registry. The remote images from the container registry will be used in kubernetes deployments:

With example variable settings as above, run the following commands to tag the images:
