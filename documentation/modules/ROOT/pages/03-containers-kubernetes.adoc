At the end of this chapter you will be able to :

* Containerize the Quarkus Application
* Build and run the Quarkus Application in Kubernetes

[#conk8s-prerequisite]
== Prerequisite

include::partial$prereq-cli.adoc[]

[#conk8s-build-container-app]
== Containerize Quarkus Application

include::ROOT:partial$build-containers.adoc[tag=build]

After containerizing the application, we can verify the container by running the following commands: 

include::ROOT:partial$build-containers.adoc[tag=run]

You can <<conk8s-call-svc>> to see a response like `hello`.
 
[#conk8s-call-svc]
== Invoke Service
The simple `hello` REST URI can be called via browser using http://localhost:8080 or using CLI like: 

:doc-sec: basics
:k8s-cli: k8s
:path: hello
:k8s-env: minikube
:cli-tool: curl
:address: localhost

[#conk8s-k8s-tag-containers]
=== Tag and push the container images

As we have already built the container images, we might need to build and push it to remote container registry. The remote images from the container registry will be used in kubernetes deployments:

With example variable settings as above, run the following commands to tag the images:
